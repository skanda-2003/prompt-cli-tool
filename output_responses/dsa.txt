Mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) requires dedication, persistence, and a well-structured study plan. Given your availability, I've created a comprehensive study plan for weekdays (3-4 hours) and weekends (6-7 hours). This plan will help you build a strong foundation in DSA, covering topics from scratch to advanced levels.

**Weekdays (3-4 hours)**

1. **Warm-up and Review (15 minutes)**
	* Start by reviewing the previous day's material or doing some simple coding exercises to get your mind ready.
2. **Core Concept Study (45 minutes)**
	* Focus on a specific DSA concept, such as:
		+ Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
		+ Basic Sorting Algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Selection Sort)
		+ Searching Algorithms (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search)
	* Read and take notes on the concept, and try to implement it using a programming language like Python or Java.
3. **Practice Problems (60 minutes)**
	* Use online platforms like:
		+ LeetCode (5-10 problems)
		+ HackerRank (5-10 problems)
		+ GeeksforGeeks (5-10 problems)
	* Focus on solving problems related to the core concept you studied earlier.
4. **Review and Reflection (30 minutes)**
	* Review what you've learned, and reflect on:
		+ What worked well?
		+ What didn't work as expected?
		+ How can you improve your understanding?

**Weekends (6-7 hours)**

1. **Core Concept Study (2 hours)**
	* Focus on a new or more advanced DSA concept, such as:
		+ Dynamic Programming
		+ Greedy Algorithms
		+ Divide and Conquer
	* Read and take notes on the concept, and try to implement it using a programming language like Python or Java.
2. **Practice Problems (3 hours)**
	* Use online platforms like:
		+ LeetCode (10-15 problems)
		+ HackerRank (10-15 problems)
		+ GeeksforGeeks (10-15 problems)
	* Focus on solving problems related to the core concept you studied earlier.
3. **Review and Reflection (1 hour)**
	* Review what you've learned, and reflect on:
		+ What worked well?
		+ What didn't work as expected?
		+ How can you improve your understanding?
4. **Additional Practice or Review (1-2 hours)**
	* Use this time to:
		+ Practice more problems related to the core concept
		+ Review previously studied concepts
		+ Work on a project that incorporates DSA concepts

**Additional Tips**

1. **Create a schedule and stick to it**: Make sure you're consistent with your study routine, even on weekends.
2. **Use flashcards or notes**: Take notes while studying, and review them periodically to reinforce your understanding.
3. **Join online communities or forums**: Participate in online discussions, such as Reddit's r/learnprogramming or r/leetcode, to stay motivated and get help when needed.
4. **Take breaks and practice self-care**: Don't overexert yourself; take breaks, exercise, and maintain a healthy work-life balance.
5. **Celebrate small wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate your progress along the way, no matter how small.

**Timeline**

* Week 1-2: Focus on basic data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues) and simple algorithms (sorting, searching)
* Week 3-4: Study more advanced data structures (trees, graphs) and algorithms (dynamic programming, greedy algorithms)
* Week 5-6: Practice solving problems related to the concepts you've learned
* Week 7-12: Continue practicing and reviewing, focusing on more challenging problems and projects

**Tips for Mastery**

1. **Understand the concepts**: Don't just memorize formulas or code snippets; take the time to understand the underlying principles.
2. **Practice consistently**: Consistency is key to mastering DSA. Aim to practice regularly, even if it's just for a few minutes each day.
3. **Review and reflect**: Regularly review what you've learned, reflecting on what worked well and what didn't. Adjust your study plan as needed.

By following this study plan, you'll be well on your way to mastering Data Structures and Algorithms. Stay committed, persistent, and patient, and you'll achieve your goals!
