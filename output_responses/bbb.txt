Here's my feedback:

**Grammar:** 8/10
The writing is generally clear and concise, with no major grammatical errors. However, the sentence "Some studies found a correlation, but correlation doesn't imply causation" could be rephrased to improve clarity.

**Clarity:** 9/10
The essay starts by challenging a common belief, which immediately grabs the reader's attention. The language is straightforward and easy to understand, making it accessible to a wide audience.

**Coherence:** 8/10
The essay presents a clear thesis statement (video games don't lead to violent behavior) and supports it with some logical reasoning (research is inconclusive). However, the argument could be further developed and nuanced.

**Argument quality:** 7/10
While the essay challenges a common belief, it mainly relies on logical fallacies (correlation doesn't imply causation) rather than concrete evidence or in-depth analysis. The argument could be strengthened by incorporating specific studies or data that support the claim.

**Use of evidence:** 5/10
The essay mentions some research, but it's not clear which specific studies are being referred to. Additionally, there is no direct citation or reference to these studies, which makes it difficult to verify their validity and relevance. Providing concrete evidence from credible sources would significantly enhance the argument.

Overall score: 7.5/10

Reasoning:

The essay has a clear thesis statement and starts strong by challenging a common belief. However, the argument relies too heavily on logical fallacies rather than concrete evidence or in-depth analysis. Additionally, there is room for improvement in terms of clarity and coherence, particularly in the second sentence. To strengthen the argument, it would be beneficial to incorporate specific studies or data that support the claim and provide clear citations and references.
